In fact, it's a double bind, insofar as I'm announced as the lunchtime speaker, and there is no lunch. No free lunch, no. But it's coming, and the next one. But I had thought about the challenge of trying to present while you're eating, and at least I've avoided that, even though I don't have the, at least I have the sense in which there's hunger among you. I want to thank Richard, or sorry, Peter Kaufman, for inviting me to this. I want to give you a little bit of a background in terms of where I'm coming from. I'm actually on the panel twice to talk about publishing in a later session, but at this point, I want to talk about the economics of knowledge as a public good. And one of Richard's remarks that we shouldn't even be talking about the economics is kind of troubling to me. But I immediately thought of the famous free chalk movement that did so poorly as an effort to bring educational materials to everyone. You don't remember the free chalk movement. It was one of those same kinds of spirited things in which the economics weren't important, but the principle, the educational principle, was at the forefront. And that I think there are practical questions that we do need to address. And I think Anne set the stage this morning in thinking about and mentioning the word funding. And I want to come not out of disrespect for Gandhi. I want to come at this in terms of a different approach, partly out of my own background. I am a professor of education. I work at the University of British Columbia, and I have a day job, which is the preparation of English teachers for the schools in Vancouver, where it doesn't turn white like this at all. It just rains continuously through this whole season. And one of the things I just learned this morning, or failed to appreciate before, is it's not just that it rains, it's that rain isn't bright like snow, and that it really brightens up things to have the snow around, whereas our rain keeps it kind of dark and dull without the sun. There are other advantages. I get to bike to work and things like that. But I want to consider the economics of knowledge as a public good in a number of different ways. But the principal idea, I think, is value. Now, almost everything I have in my notes has been mentioned by the previous.",
